# mintyfresh
Mintyfresh is an amenity-finding application for Android that aims to provide a simple method for new students on college campuses to locate amenities (such as bathrooms, vending machines, printers...) near them. 

The application is currently built for the **Georgia Tech campus**, but will be generalized with an admin tool in future.

## Building
Mintyfresh is built in Android Studio - simply clone the repository and open the included `mintyfresh.iml` file to open the project, or clone directly from within Android Studio.

## Database
Mintyfresh requires the use of an external MySQL database as its data source. A schema will be provided when the project is complete.
